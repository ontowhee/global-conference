Have you heard of the [PyLadiesCon](/announcement-pyladies-conference)? Do you
want to speak there but donâ€™t know how to do it? What is a [call for
proposal](/http://localhost:4321/announcement-cfp-launch) and what do you need
to submit? Worry not, we will have a CfP (Call for Proposal) workshop for new
speakers who have not done it before.

In the workshop, via some exercises, we will help you to find something you
want to talk about and start drafting a very rough proposal as a start.

Workshop 1 - Date: 29th Aug 2023 - Time: 10:00 UTC - Venue: online
